# remote-view-plugin
## A [Jenkins CI](https://jenkins-ci.org/) plugin to view build jobs on remote [Jenkins CI](https://jenkins-ci.org/) servers

### What does this plugin provide?
This [Jenkins CI](https://jenkins-ci.org/) plugin provides a view that will show you the build status of jobs executed on remote (master) [Jenkins CI](https://jenkins-ci.org/) servers. You can specify several remote [Jenkins CI](https://jenkins-ci.org/) servers to be listed in one view. Also you can select which (remote) jobs should be listed.

### How can I use it?
Clone the repository, build the project (using Apache Maven) and install the resulting remote-view-plugin.hpi plugin into your [Jenkins CI](https://jenkins-ci.org/) server which should display the new view.
